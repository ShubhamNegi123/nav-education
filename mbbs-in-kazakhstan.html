                        <h2>MBBS IN KAZKHSTAN</h2>
                        <p>Indian students looking for similar quality of medical education in comparison to Indian
                            medical education, and that too in a much lower fee is making them opt for Study MBBS in
                            Kazakhstan option. This is the single most important factor attracting more and more
                            students towards Kazakhstan, affordable low fee structure of their medical universities.
                            Average fee for studying MBBS in Kazakhstan is from USD 3000 to USD 4500 per year. At
                            present more than 5000 Indian students are studying MBBS in Kazakhstan's various
                            universities. These numbers speaks the story as to how medicine degree aspirants are turning

                            below.
                            <br>
                            This could happen just because of some drastic measures taken by Kazakhstan government some
                            years back, which transformed their traditional medical education infrastructure to the
                            modern digitalized, well equipped, latest lab technology based one. Kazakhstan is fast
                            becoming heart of central Asia and developing faster than its neighboring nations. Almost
                            all the top medical universities of Kazakhstan are WDOMS - World Directory of Medical
                            Schools listed universities with approvals from WHO and UNESCO. They are also recognized by
                            various national medical bodies like NMC ( National Medical Council ) formerly MCI ( Medical
                            Council of India ), USMLE, PLAB, IMED and GMC. These recognitions provide the successfully
                            graduated doctors to practice in different parts of the world, after clearing the respective
                            screening test as per the country they opt for.
                            <br>
                            The medium of instruction for education in Kazakhstan medical universities is mostly
                            English, so for students from around the globe, including India feel comfortable while
                            deciding about joining a course there. Apart from this, the eligibility criteria to get
                            admission is very simple for Indian students. Which enables students to directly apply after
                            NEET ( National Eligibility cum Entrance Exam ) every year, which is mandatory as per
                            government guidelines, if students later on want to practice in India. Navchetana
                            international education is the best consultant for MBBS in abroad.
